        <h3>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-Based Traffic Signal Controllers</h3>
        <span>The project focuses on the development and implementation of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based Traffic Signal Controllers using the SUMO traffic simulator. Traffic signal controllers play a crucial role in managing traffic flow and reducing congestion on road networks. By leveraging DRL techniques, the project aims to create intelligent traffic signal controllers that can adapt and optimize signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions.</span>
